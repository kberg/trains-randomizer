    <p><b>Notes:</b></p>

    <p>The min counts have to be 8 or less.</p>

    <p>If you want attack cards, set the minimum number of attack cards
    you want, and be sure to include the Rising Sun cards. Even if it's 0
    I bet you'll still get some once in a while because having a minimum
    doesn't mean you won't get any.</p>

    <p>Patches are welcome! Most of all, enjoy!</p>
